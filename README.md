# A game about eating apples

Meant to save a list of high scores. There are currently 2 game manager scripts in it: GameManageScriptV2 has code in it to save one high score to a file. I implemented it solely for the function of actually getting a hs.txt file to generate, which the game manager which saves a list of high scores could not do.
